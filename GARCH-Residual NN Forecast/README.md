Two Jupyter notebooks are used to predict the Historical Volatility in this folder.

Normal NN volatility forecast notebook used 8 common Machine Learning (Deep Learning) models - **Transformer, CNN, SVR, LSTM, BiLSTM, Transformer, MLP, RNN, GRNN, RBFNN**

RES-NN Volatility Forecast notebook used our new **Revised Input Way** of importing information to the above 8 NN models to improve the prediction performance of Historical Volatility.

The Dataset composed of 6 financial assets used to test the effect of our improved models comes from different fields: **Stock indices in different countries, Bulk products, Cryptocurrencies**

The Framework of Machine Learning is **TensorFlow**
